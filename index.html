        <br />
        Seriously, these cookies are good.
        <br />

        <span id='randall'>The Randall</span>
        - Named after our uncle Randall who back in the fall of 1978 rose to fame as the Upper South Northwest Regional Champion of Salmon punching.  The guy had a hell of a right cross that just sent the fish a'flyin!  And this cookie will do the same to you! Feel like you've been smacked in the gob by our uncle Randall!
